Formal Language Generation for Fault Diagnosis with Spectral Logic via Adversarial Training
Fault diagnosis with formal languages can be performed in an interpretable way.  However, traditional formal languages cannot deal with noisy environments. Additionally, finding the optimal formal language for fault diagnosis is still a challenge due to the sparse   reward issue.    This paper presents a novel method to find  formal languages, written with signal spectral logic (SSL), to describe the fault behaviours among frequency domain for fault diagnosis.  The formal language defined by SSL is robust to noise, acts as the fault diagnoser, and provides interpretabilities for human operators. Moreover,  the fault diagnoser construction  procedure has been formulated as a language generation process and an adversarial training technique is used to find the optimal formal language and avoid sparse reward issue existing in language generation problems.  Some experiments with real rolling element bearing data and simulated signals demonstrate  that our method is able to find formal languages to diagnose faults efficiently and accurately under noisy environments.
